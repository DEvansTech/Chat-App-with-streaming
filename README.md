## üîê React Native Compatibility

To use this library you need to ensure you match up with the correct version of React Native you are using.

| `stream-chat-react-native` version | Required React Native Version |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `3.x.x` (alpha)                           | `>= 0.60` |
| `2.x.x`                                   | `>= 0.60` |

## üìñ React Native Chat Tutorial

The best place to start is the [React Native Chat Tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/react-native-chat/tutorial/). It teaches you how to use this SDK and also shows how to make frequently required changes.

## üîÆ Example Apps

This repo includes 4 example apps. One made with Expo, one Native JavaScript code, and two in TypeScript. One TypeScript app is a simple implementation for reference, the other is a more full featured app example.

## üöÄ Upgrading

Please refer to [Upgrade Helper](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Upgrade-helper)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common issues

#### While running native example, you may (not necessarily) run into the following issues

1. When you execute `yarn ios` for the first time, it starts a metro bundler in parallel. It can result in some errors since the build process isn't complete yet. Try the following to fix this:
   1. Close/stop the metro bundler process.
   2. Let the build process finish. It can usually take around 2-3 minutes for the first time.
   3. Start the metro bundler manually by executing `yarn start` inside `stream-chat-react-native/examples/NativeMessaging` directory.
2. When you execute `yarn android`, you may (not necessarily) run into following error:

   ```ERROR
   info Starting JS server...
   info Building and installing the app on the device (cd android && ./gradlew app:installDebug)...
   Starting a Gradle Daemon, 1 incompatible Daemon could not be reused, use --status for details

   FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

   * What went wrong:
   A problem occurred configuring project ':@react-native-community_netinfo'.
   > SDK location not found. Define location with sdk.dir in the local.properties file or with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

   * Try:
   Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

   * Get more help at https://help.gradle.org

   BUILD FAILED in 13s
   error Could not install the app on the device, read the error above for details.
   Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected and have
   set up your Android development environment:
   https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
   error Command failed: ./gradlew app:installDebug. Run CLI with --verbose flag for more details.
   ```

   To resolve this, do the following.

   1. Create a file named `local.properties` inside `stream-chat-react-native/examples/NativeMessaging/android` directory
   2. Put the this line in that file. Make sure sdk path is correctly mentioned as per your system:

      ```
      sdk.dir=/Users/{user_name}/Library/Android/sdk/
      ```

   3. Rerun `yarn android` in `stream-chat-react-native/examples/NativeMessaging` directory
