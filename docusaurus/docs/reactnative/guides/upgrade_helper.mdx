Guide to help with upgrading from v2 to v3 of `stream-chat-react-native`.

Version 3 of React Native SDK has been a major architectural change. The new implementation takes advantage of React Context along with many popular
community libraries such as [Reanimated V2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs) to deliver a superior chat experience.
Upgrading will require re-implementing your integration but will yield performance and functional benefits.

## Dependency changes

Before you begin the upgrade, we would recommend you to comment out all the component customizations related props on `ChannelList`, `Channel` or `MessageList` that you may have in your application.
This way you can test setup part of upgrade independently from customizations.

### Add peer-dependencies

v3 has introduced plenty of new peer-dependencies for the package. So please install the required dependencies:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-community/blur @react-native-community/cameraroll @react-native-community/netinfo @stream-io/flat-list-mvcp react-native-document-picker react-native-fs react-native-gesture-handler react-native-haptic-feedback react-native-haptic-feedback react-native-image-crop-picker react-native-image-resizer react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context react-native-share react-native-svg
```

Go through following links for necessary additional installation steps for the peer dependencies:

- `react-native` - [additional installation steps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#gif-and-webp-support-on-android)
- `react-native-reanimated` - [additional installation steps](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/installation).
- `react-native-image-crop-picker` - [additional installation steps](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker#step-3)
- `react-native-cameraroll` - [additional installation steps](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll#permissions)
- `react-native-gesture-handler` - [additional installation steps](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/#android)
- `@react-native-community/blur` - [additional installation steps](/reactnative/basics/troubleshooting#blurview-crashing)

### Remove `react-native-get-random-values`

Remove the `react-native-get-random-values` dependency (unless you have used it explicitely in your application) which was required in v2 of `stream-chat-react-native`.

```bash
yarn remove react-native-get-random-values
```

Also remove the following line from your root (`index.js`/`index.ts`) file

```tsx {1}
import * from react-native-get-random-values; // <-- REMOVE THIS
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';

import App from './App';
import { name as appName } from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

### Import gesture handler dependency

Import gesture handler dependency at the top of the entry file before anything else, this is usually your App.js or index.js file.

```tsx {1}
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';

import App from './App';
import { name as appName } from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

### Add `stream-chat@3.x.x` dependency

Minimum supported version of `stream-chat` - v3.x.
Please check the [Compatibility Table](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native#-react-native-compatibility) to ensure you are using
correct version of `stream-chat` dependency.

```bash
yarn add stream-chat@3.11.1
```

## Add `OverlayProvider` component

[`OverlayProvider`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx) component should wrap the entire chat screen in your application. If you are using react-navigation, this component
should wrap your stack provider. Please read more details in our [Configuring Components docs](../basics/hello_stream_chat.mdx#configuring-ui-components)

```tsx
import { OverlayProvider } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

export const Screen = () =>
  <OverlayProvider>
    {/** App components */}
  </OverlayProvider>
```

## Theme changes

v2 of SDK used [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for theming purpose, which we have abondoned in v3.
So following pattern of theming will **NOT** work anymore

```tsx
const theme = {
  'message.actionSheet.titleContainer': `background-color: 'black', padding: 10px`,
  'message.actionSheet.titleText': `color: 'white'`,
};

<Chat client={chatClient} style={theme}>
</Chat>
```

We have published a separate [guide](../customization/theming.mdx) for how to apply custom theme on chat components.


At this point if you launch the application, it should be working fine (assuming all the component customizations have been commented out) ðŸŽ‰

## Message customization prop change

Message UI is the most common usecase of customization. In v2 of the library, you could provide a `Message` prop to `MessageList` component,
to provide custom component for rendering a message UI. But in v3, you need to provide `MessageSimple` prop on Channel component instead.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align='center' width="33%">
      <img src={messagePropChangeBefore}/>
    </td>
    <td align='center' width="33%">
      <img src={messagePropChangeAfter}/>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <td align='center'>Before upgrade to v3</td>
    <td align='center'>After upgrade to v3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

More details are mentioned in next section regarding prop changes.

## Moving from prop drilling to context

As part of v3, we have tried to get rid of prop drilling pattern as much as possible. We are moving towards using [react's context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
based architecture.

Let's take an [example](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki/Cookbook-(2.x.x)#senders-name-at-bottom-of-the-message) from v2 documentation
which shows how to render message sender's name at bottom of the message:

```tsx
import { Chat, Channel, MessageList, MessageSimple } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const MessageWithSenderNameAtBottom = props => {
  return (
    <MessageSimple
      {...props}
      MessageFooter={props => <Text>{props.message.user.name}</Text>}
    />
  );
};

// In your rendering logic
<Chat client={client}>
  <Channel channel={channel}>
    <MessageList Message={MessageWithSenderNameAtBottom} />
  </Channel>
</Chat>
```

To customize `MessageFooter`, you had to first create separate component to render `MessageSimple` component and then provide prop `MessageFooter` to `MessageSimple`.
This is what the prop drilling looked like in v2 of the SDK. But in v3, this is much simplified as you can customize each of these deeply nested components
by providing relevant prop on one of the following 3 core components (depending on which component needs to be customized).

- [`OverlayProvider`](../core-components/overlay_provider.mdx#props)
- [`Channel`](../core-components/channel.mdx#props)
- [`ChannelList`](../core-components/channel_list.mdx#props)

Additionally you have access to all the required values through contexts (`props.message` in this example).
Please check documentation of [contexts](../customizations/contexts.mdx) for all the available contexts.

The customization of MessageFooter will look like following after upgrade to v3.

```tsx
import { Chat, Channel, MessageList, useMessageContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const FooterWithSenderName = () => {
  const { message } = useMessageContext();

  return <Text>{props.message.user.name}</Text>;
};

// In your rendering logic
<Chat client={client}>
  <Channel channel={channel} MessageFooter={FooterWithSenderName}>
    <MessageList />
  </Channel>
</Chat>
```
