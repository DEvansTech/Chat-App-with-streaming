`ChannelsContext` is provided by [`ChannelList`](../../core-components/channel-list) component. If you are not familiar with React Context API, please read about it on [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Basic Usage

`ChannelsContext` can be consumed by any of the child  component of `ChannelList` component as following:

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ChannelsContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const { channels, reloadList } = useContext(ChannelsContext);
```

Alternatively, you can also use `useChannelsContext` hook provided by library to consume ChannelsContext.

```tsx
import { useChannelsContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const { channels, reloadList } = useChannelsContext();
```
