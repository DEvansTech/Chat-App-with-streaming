`ChannelContext` is provided by [`Channel`](../core-components/channel) component. If you are not familiar with React Context API, please read about it on [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Basic Usage

`ChannelContext` can be consumed by any of the child  component of `Chat` component as following:

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { ChannelContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const { lastRead, reloadChannel, watcherCount } = useContext(ChannelContext);
```

Alternatively, you can also use `useChannelContext` hook provided by library to consume ChannelContext.

```tsx
import { useChannelContext } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

const { lastRead, reloadChannel, watcherCount } = useChannelContext();
```

:::caution
We don't recommend using `ChannelContext` at message level, since changes to its value may result in re-rendering of all the messages. And this can introduce performance issue
