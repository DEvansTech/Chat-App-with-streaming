  This needs to be a reference because the functions using it are not memoized (because they change too much even if you do
  due to the dependencies they have) and they're called on connection state changes on the client which are subscribed on
  mount with an useEffect so they're always getting only the first function reference which uses the old value of this
  active channels array (would always be empty). Using a ref solves this problem cause then it will always be updated to
  the latest one.
