Any component can be made a consumer of [KeyboardContext](#keyboardcontext) by using function `withKeyboardContext`.

e.g.,

```js static
const DemoComponentWithKeyboardContext = withKeyboardContext(DemoComponent);

class DemoComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Button
        onPress={() => this.props.dismissKeyboard}
        title="Button to dismiss keyboard"
      />
    );
  }
}
```
