/**
 * KeyboardCompatibleView is HOC component similar to [KeyboardAvoidingView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/keyboardavoidingview),
 * designed to work with MessageInput and MessageList component.
 *
 * Main motivation of writing this our own component was to get rid of issues that come with KeyboardAvoidingView from react-native
 * when used with components of fixed height. [Channel](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/blob/master/src/components/ChannelInner.js) component
 * uses `KeyboardCompatibleView` internally, so you don't need to explicitely add it.
 *
 * ```json
 * <KeyboardCompatibleView>
 *  <MessageList />
 *  <MessageInput />
 * </KeyboardCompatibleView>
 * ```
